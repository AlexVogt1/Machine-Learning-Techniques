# CNN from Scratch
In this folder I created a CNN and all its associated functions in a similar
to pytorch. I also demonstrate the performance of a basic CNN on synthetic data.
See `CNN_first_principles.ipynb`
## Performance
Synthetic Data (Classifying horizontal and Vertical lines) = 100%

## TODO for improvements
- [ ] Add demonstration on actual data (like MNIST)
- [ ] Add data augmentation functions
