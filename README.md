# Machine Leaning Techniques

This Repo contains machine learning teachnique (and tasks completed in my university career)
\
- No feature selection/engineering was done on the data as the main perpose was to show that I could build the various machine learning techniques from first principles
- only basic data cleaning was performed for outlier removal and to imporve data repesentation
