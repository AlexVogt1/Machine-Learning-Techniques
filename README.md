# Machine Leaning Techniques

This Repo contains machine learning techniques (and tasks completed in my university career)
- No feature selection/engineering was done on the data as the main purpose was to show that I could build the various machine learning techniques from first principles
- only basic data cleaning was performed to improve data repesentation
